/** An abstract XACT SoundBank interface.
 *
 *  This interface allows us to treat both binary and ASCII variants
 *  of the XSB file the same.
 *
 *  An XACT SoundBank is part of Microsoft's Cross-platform Audio
 *  Creation Tool (XACT), and commonly used together with WaveBanks,
 *  which contain the actual audio data.
 *
 *  Conceptually, a soundbank consists of cues and sounds. A sound is a
 *  collection of tracks, which each contain a list of events and a list
 *  of wave variations, while a cue consists of a list of references to
 *  sounds.
 *
 *  Both the cue variation and the wave variation can be selected using
 *  different methods. For example, they could be played in order, or
 *  randomly. Or they could be explicitly selected by game.
 *
 *  See also xactsoundbank_binary.h for the original Xbox version of
 *  the XSB file and xactsoundbank_ascii.h for the textual representation.
 *
 *  For the abstract WaveBank interface, see xactwavebank.h.
